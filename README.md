# Tech test: FESTIVITIES API



Festivities are special times different places have to celebrate their local habits, manners,historical dates and other events. These events always have a name, a start date and end date and the place where they are celebrated.

## Context Diagram

In this short diagram, you can see the approach to implementing this API. A script was created with Docker Compose for the deployment of the application and database containers using Django and PostgresDB, additionally a "postgres_data" volume was created to persist the database information.

## CI PIPELINE

In this diagram, you can see a simple approach given for the Continuous Integration Pipeline. GitHub actions were used for unit test processing and code coverage.

## Requeriments

This API requires:

```bash
* Python versión = 3.8
* PostgreSQL version >= 12
* Install virtual environment manager 'pipenv' (https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
* Install docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started)
```

## Architecture and Design Choices

### Settings

This API separates Django settings to develop, staging and production environments.

All settings are located in `main.settings` as a package and this package contains four separate modules:

- **`main.settings.base`:** This file contains *default* settings that are generated with `django-admin startproject`.
- **`main.settings.develop`:** This file contains the settings for development environment.
- **`main.settings.staging`:** This file contains the settings for staging environment.
- **`main.settings.production`:** This file contains the settings production environment.

You can select which environment to run by setting the environment variable SETTINGS_MODULE. By default, `manage.py` and `main/wsgi.py` uses the` develop` settings.

The overall import schema for settings are as below:

```
└── base
    ├── development
    └── staging
    └── production
```

### PostgreSQL

This API already assumes that you will use PostgreSQL. It installs and is preconfigured to work with PostgreSQL. Check your `.env` file in the project root to further configure your setup.

### DotEnv

Due to twelve-factor app conventions, separating your configuration from application is considered to be a better practice. This API comes batteries included to use .env files in your codebase and already has a .env example file. You have to copy this file to your project root as .env for your project to run.

After copying, you better review your config file to make some changes such as secret key and database settings.



## Quick Start

### Deploy with Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository with the command "git clone https://github.com/cmartinezbjmu/muni-festivities.git"

2. Create an `.env` file.

3. Excecute this command:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

Now you can see the server running on the IP http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Local Deploy

1. Clone the repository with the command "git clone https://github.com/cmartinezbjmu/muni-festivities.git"

2. Create an `.env` file.

3. Init your virtual environtmen 

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

4. Excecute the database migrations

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Finally, init the application

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
